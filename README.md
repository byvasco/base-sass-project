# Base SASS Project

This is my go-to file structure for my front-end projects.

The code is separated in 3 directories, each one containing an `index` file that imports all partials.

## 1. Base
Where I define the project variables, mixins, typography rules, etc.

## 2. Components
Where I style all the site components individually.

## 3. Layout
Where I set margins between the components of a specific page.
